            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <p>Instagram</p>
            <p><a href="instagram.com">instagram.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/instagram.jpg" alt="screenshot of instagram home page">
            <p>The main reason that I noticed that the Instagram mobile webpage illustrates excellent proximity is that different interactions are grouped closely together. For example, all of the instagram stories are in the same smaller circles in close proximity in a line near the top of the page. Also, the Instagram posts have the picture, caption, likes, and comments for the same post all together before scrolling down and viewing the next post so that it is easy to tell what goes to each post.</p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <p>Brigham Young University - Idaho</p>
            <p><a href="byui.edu">byui.edu</a></p>
            <img src="images/byui.jpg" alt="screenshot of BYUI homepage">
            <p>While the Brigham Young University - Idaho mobile webpage looks very similar to the desktop webpage, they made each component block so that they were stacked on top of eachother. Each stacked component is perfectly aligned on both the left and the right all the way down the page.</p>

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>Apple</p>
            <p><a href="apple.com">apple.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="screenshot of apple home page">
            <p>The Apple mobile webpage shows constrast mainly in the color of their typography and background. The coloring is either white on black or black on white which provides great contrast and makes it very easy to read the text. There is also contrast in the blue link colors.</p>
